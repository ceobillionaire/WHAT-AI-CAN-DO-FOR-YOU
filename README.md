"*A hundred years ago electricity transformed countless industries; 20 years ago the internet did, too. Artificial intelligence is about to do the same. To take advantage, companies need to understand what AI can do.*" - Andrew Ng

If you are a newcomer to the AI, the first question you may have is "**_What AI can do now and how it relates to my strategies?_**" Here are the breakthrough AI papers and `CODE` for any industry.

### 4.0 (WIP) Breakthrough AI Papers and CODE for Any Industry.

The following is constructed in accordance with the following three guiding principles:

1. *Focus on state-of-the-art*;
2. *From generic to specific areas*; and
3. *Clarity, efficiency and transparency*.

Being able to deploy with the least possible delay is key.
